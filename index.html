        <p>There is no city in the world as powerful as Naples. The energy here can be overwhelming, and can be perceived as intrusive, anarchic, loud, disordered… pure creative chaos. But there is another side to Naples: aristocratic, sophisticated, genuine, esoteric, sacred. We will show you this Naples.</p>
        <p>We will accompany you on a journey around the city and within yourself to discover physical places as well as places of pure energy. A journey that will transform the way you perceive and understand reality.</p>

        <p>During this interactive retreat, you will visit well-known as well as off-the-beaten-track sites, with guides that will show you and tell you about the esoteric nature of symbols, statues, paintings, that would constitute the hidden language of the initiates.</p>
        <p>While on the organised tours we will eat excellent food based on the concept of a balanced meal. This is a meal that contains a variety of nutrients in appropriate proportions to promote overall health and wellbeing. This helps ensure that the meal provides the right amount of carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals to sustain your daily activities and enhance the experiences we propose during the weekend workshop. We will teach you how to prepare your own balanced meal whenever you want!</p>
        <p>The weekend will be fully dedicated to the transformative experiences of the workshop: Exploring Consciousness. This is an intensive 2-day programme that offers the opportunity to explore expanded states of consciousness that facilitate self-discovery, empowerment and personal transformation.</p>
        <p>This workshop introduces the participants to the use of the Hemi-Sync® audio technology for the explorations of our consciousness. During the workshop we will practice audio exercises and do engaging activities that provide numerous opportunities for exploration and self-discovery.</p>
        <p>The frequencies will enhance and reawaken the natural abilities of your brain and help you realise through direct experience that you are more than your physical body.</p>

        <p>Here’s how a balanced meal can be structured:</p>
        <p>Vegetables: Ideally, half of the plate should be filled with vegetables. Try to include a variety of colors and types, both raw and cooked, for a range of nutrients.</p>
        <p>Proteins: About a quarter of the plate should consist of protein sources such as chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, or legumes (beans and lentils).</p>
        <p>Complex carbohydrates: Another quarter of the plate should contain complex carbohydrates like whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, or whole grain pasta) or starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes).</p>
        <p>Healthy fats: Incorporate healthy fats from sources like olive oil, avocado, or nuts. These fats are important for nutrient absorption and overall health.</p>
        <p>Hydration: Accompany your meal with water, the best choice for staying hydrated.</p>
        <p>A balanced meal helps you maintain nutritional balance, providing your body with the energy and nutrients it needs to function at its best. This approach can be adjusted based on your individual dietary needs and health goals.</p>
        <p>During the two-day course you experience two states of consciousness: Focus 10, state of “body asleep and mind awake”; and Focus 12, the state of expanded awareness. Accessing and exploring these states allow you to know and better understand your Total Self, while accessing new or unexplored inner resources.</p>
        <p>Some participants also report experiences of contact and communication with deceased loved ones, out-of-body experiences (OBEs) and astral travel, and other mystical experiences. However, this does not happen often and cannot be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>What we do promise is that you will return home with new experiences, new knowledge and newly-found skills useful for accessing and taking advantage of these expanded states of consciousness. And you will be able to do so on your own without using Hemi-Sync®.</p>
